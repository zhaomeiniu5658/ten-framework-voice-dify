"""Tests for the reconnect lock pattern.

Verifies that concurrent reconnect triggers are properly serialized
using asyncio.Lock.locked() guard followed by await lock.acquire().
In a single-threaded async event loop there is no preemption between
locked() and the subsequent acquire(), so the TOCTOU gap is safe.
