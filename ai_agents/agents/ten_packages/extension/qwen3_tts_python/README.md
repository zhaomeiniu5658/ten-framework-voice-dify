### Example Configurations

#### Custom Voice with Instruction

```json
{
    "params": {
        "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-CustomVoice",
        "mode": "custom_voice",
        "language": "English",
        "speaker": "Ryan",
        "instruct": "Speak in a warm and friendly tone"
    }
}
```

#### Voice Cloning

```json
{
    "params": {
        "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base",
        "mode": "voice_clone",
        "language": "English",
        "ref_audio_path": "/path/to/reference.wav",
        "ref_text": "This is the transcript of the reference audio."
    }
}
```

#### Voice Design

```json
{
    "params": {
        "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-VoiceDesign",
        "mode": "voice_design",
        "language": "English",
        "voice_description": "A warm, mature female voice with a slight British accent, speaking at a moderate pace with clear enunciation."
    }
}
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- CUDA-capable GPU with at least 8GB VRAM (for 1.7B models) or 4GB (for 0.6B models)
- FlashAttention 2 (recommended for optimal performance)

### Installation

```bash
pip install qwen-tts torch numpy pydantic

# Optional: Install FlashAttention 2 for better performance
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

## Usage Notes

1. **First Request Latency**: The model is loaded lazily on the first TTS request, which may take a few seconds.

2. **GPU Memory**: The 1.7B models require approximately 6-8GB of GPU memory. Use the 0.6B models for lower memory requirements.

3. **Voice Cloning**: For best results, use 3-10 seconds of clear reference audio with matching transcript.

4. **Instruction Control**: Works with CustomVoice and VoiceDesign models. Base models do not support instructions.
