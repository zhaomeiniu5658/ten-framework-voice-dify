# Contributing to TEN Framework

Welcome to the TEN Framework community! We're excited to have you contribute to building the future of real-time conversational AI agents. This guide will help you get started with contributing to the project.

## 🌟 Ways to Contribute

We welcome all forms of contributions:

- **Code contributions**: Bug fixes, new features, performance improvements
- **Documentation**: Improving docs, tutorials, examples  
- **Bug reports**: Identifying and reporting issues
- **Feature requests**: Suggesting new functionality
- **Community support**: Helping others in discussions and issues
- **Extensions**: Creating new extensions for the ecosystem

## 📋 Before You Start

### Required Reading

1. Read our [Code of Conduct](./CLA.md) - all contributors must follow our community guidelines
2. Sign the [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](../../CLA.md) - required for all contributions
3. Review the project [README](../../README.md) to understand the architecture

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the required tools installed:

- **Docker / Docker Compose** (for development environment)
- **Node.js v20+** (for frontend development)  
- **Python 3.8+** (for AI agent development)
- **Go** (for backend server development)
- **Task** (task runner - install via `npm install -g @go-task/cli`)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub first, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ten-framework.git
cd ten-framework
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Navigate to AI agents directory
cd ai_agents

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env file with your API keys:
# - AGORA_APP_ID and AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE
# - OpenAI, Deepgram, ElevenLabs API keys as needed

# Start development containers
docker compose up -d

# Enter the container
docker exec -it ten_agent_dev bash

# Build the agent (takes 5-8 minutes)
task use

# Build and run
task build
task run
```

### 3. Development Workflow

The project uses Task as the build system. Key commands:

```bash
# Core development commands
task build          # Build the project
task test           # Run all tests
task lint           # Run linting
task format         # Format code
task clean          # Clean build artifacts

# AI Agents specific
task use AGENT=agents/examples/demo    # Switch to different agent
task run-server     # Run backend server
task run-gd-server  # Run graph designer
```

## 🔧 Making Changes

### Code Guidelines

1. **Follow existing patterns**: Review similar code before implementing
2. **Use existing libraries**: Check if the codebase already uses needed dependencies
3. **Security first**: Never expose secrets or credentials
4. **No hardcoded comments**: Don't add unnecessary code comments unless requested

### Language-Specific Guidelines

**Python (AI Agents)**
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use Black formatter: `task format`
- Run pylint: `task lint`
- Add type hints where appropriate

**TypeScript/JavaScript (Playground)**
- Use existing ESLint configuration
- Follow React best practices
- Use TypeScript for new code

**Go (Server)**
- Follow Go conventions
- Use gofmt for formatting
- Add proper error handling

### Commit Guidelines

We use conventional commits:

```bash
feat: add new ASR integration
fix: resolve memory leak in audio processing  
docs: update installation instructions
test: add integration tests for TTS module
refactor: improve error handling in server
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
task test

# Test specific extension
task test-extension EXTENSION=agents/ten_packages/extension/elevenlabs_tts_python

# Test server only
task test-server

# Test agent extensions
task test-agent-extensions
```
