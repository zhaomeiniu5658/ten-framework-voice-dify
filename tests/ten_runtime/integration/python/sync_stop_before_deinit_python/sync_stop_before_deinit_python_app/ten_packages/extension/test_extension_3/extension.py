# test_extension_3: fast stopper in the dynamic graph.

# Does nothing in on_stop — returning immediately triggers on_stop_done via
# the AsyncExtension framework. With sync_stop_before_deinit enabled it cannot
# proceed to on_deinit until test_extension_2 (the slow stopper) also calls
# on_stop_done (after its 2-second sleep and on_stop_notify round-trip).
